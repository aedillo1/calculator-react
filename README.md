## About
This calculator app was created with React, and follows closely to a [tutorial guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/react-tutorial-build-calculator-app/), with the source code [provided here](https://github.com/madzadev/calculator). A few features were removed from the original tutorial, such as being able to invert values, and stylized to follow [this format](https://github.com/martysen/calculatorAppDemo)

The application was then built to run on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for users to see the final build. You can find a link to the application in the "About" section on the right, or you can [click here](https://aedillo1-calculator-react.netlify.app/).
